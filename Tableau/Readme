ðŸ“Š Tableau Dashboards

As the final step of this project, I designed a 3-page interactive Tableau dashboard to showcase both business insights and machine learning results.

ðŸ”¹ 1. Executive Overview (Business View)
   - High-level KPIs: average servings, total recipes, % high-traffic recipes, % high-calorie recipes
   - Recipe count by category (bar chart)
   - High vs unknown traffic share (donut chart)
   - Calories vs protein contribution (bubble chart)
   - Average calories & protein by category (heatmap table)
ðŸ‘‰ Purpose: Provide executives with a quick snapshot of recipe performance and traffic trends.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Nutritional Insights (Analyst View)
  - KPIs: avg calories, protein, sugar ratio, servings per recipe
  - Calories per serving by category (box plot)
  - Macronutrient ratios by category (stacked bar)
  - Average calories, protein, sugar (heatmap table)
  - Calories vs sugar ratio (scatter)
  - Calorie distribution by traffic label (line distribution)
ðŸ‘‰ Purpose: Enable analysts to explore nutrition patterns and identify calorie-dense or sugar-heavy recipes.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Model & Prediction View (Data Science Showcase)
  - KPIs: Logistic Regression & Decision Tree Accuracy + AUC
  - Confusion Matrices for both models (with TN, FP, FN, TP labels)
  - ROC curve comparison
  - Grouped bar chart: Precision, Recall, F1 by model
ðŸ‘‰ Purpose: Evaluate and compare machine learning models, showing how well they predict recipe popularity and calorie density.

ðŸ“‚ Deliverables
  - Screenshots of each page are available in the tableau/ folder.
  - Final dashboard published on Tableau Public: [Insert Your Tableau Public Link Here]

Packaged workbook (.twbx) included for reproducibility.

âš¡ This Tableau integration demonstrates how raw data â†’ Python modeling â†’ exported metrics â†’ interactive dashboards can create a full analytics pipeline for both business and technical stakeholders.
